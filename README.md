# What this is

This is an opensource project, to study and try to organize media in a cool way. I`ve been using this for a while now, and decided to make it opensource so other people could use it to organize your personal stash of home-made movies and/or media. You can find the [backend here](https://github.com/chr0nu5/johnflix-api).
